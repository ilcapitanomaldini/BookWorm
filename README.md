# Bookworm

This is a sample application to explore some features of the iOS ecosystem and Swift. Google Books API is used to fetch book information based on search queries. Results are stored in Core Data and displayed. 

Uses the following features:
 - CoreData
 - UserDefaults
 - Keychain
 - FileManager (for image cache)
 - Network ops and parsing
 - Pagination

Upgraded to _Swift 5_ and _Xcode 11.3_.

## TODO: 
 - [ ] Convert to SwiftUI
 - [ ] Implement Codable and modern Swift protocols and conventions
 - [ ] Cleanup UI
 - [ ] Add NSCache for images
